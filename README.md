## Known issues
There are some known overarching issues that affect a broad range of programs:

- Disk IO perf is relatively slow. If you run disk-intensive operations (e.g. restoring a large Git repo and/or projects with lots of node modules / Ruby Gems), you'll likely see slower performance than on native Ubuntu. The team are aware of this issue and are working to remedy in future OS releases.
- Editing Linux files in Windows apps results in data corruption. [See blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/11/17/do-not-change-linux-files-using-windows-apps-and-tools/).
- Node.js Network Interface ([#468](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/468) _FIXED IN INSIDER_)
- NETLINK and ICMP ([#69](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/69) _FIXED IN INSIDER_)
- INOTIFY filewatching ([#216](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/216) _FIXED IN INSIDER_)
- Shared Memory support (required by Postgres, etc.) ([#61](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/61) _FIXED IN INSIDER_)

## Contributing
Yes, please. Probably need screenshots or console output to verify that it's working as expected.
